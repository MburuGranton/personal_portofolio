# Managing Your Portfolio Blog with Contentful

This guide will walk you through setting up Contentful as a Content Management System (CMS) for your portfolio blog, allowing you to add and update articles remotely without touching code.

## Step 1: Create a Contentful Account

1. Go to [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) and sign up for a free account
2. After signing up, create a new space for your portfolio blog

## Step 2: Create a Content Model

In Contentful, you'll need to create a content model that matches the structure expected by your website:

1. In your Contentful space, go to "Content model" and click "Add content type"
2. Name it "Blog Post" with API identifier `blogPost`
3. Add the following fields:

| Field Name | Field ID | Field Type | Required |
|------------|----------|------------|----------|
| Title | title | Short text | Yes |
| Slug | slug | Short text | Yes |
| Excerpt | excerpt | Long text | Yes |
| Featured Image | featuredImage | Media | Yes |
| Publish Date | publishDate | Date & time | Yes |
| Read Time | readTime | Short text | Yes |
| Category | category | Short text | Yes |
| Content | content | Rich text | Yes |

4. Save the content type

## Step 3: Add Sample Content

1. Go to "Content" and click "Add entry"
2. Choose the "Blog Post" content type
3. Fill in all the required fields:
   - **Title**: Your article title
   - **Slug**: URL-friendly version of the title (e.g., "my-first-article")
   - **Excerpt**: A brief summary of the article
   - **Featured Image**: Upload an image
   - **Publish Date**: Select the publication date
   - **Read Time**: Estimated reading time (e.g., "5 min read")
   - **Category**: Article category (e.g., "Web Development")
   - **Content**: The full article content using the rich text editor
4. Click "Publish" to make the article live

## Step 4: Get API Keys

1. Go to "Settings" > "API keys"
2. Create a new API key or use the default one
3. Note down the "Space ID" and "Content Delivery API - access token"

## Step 5: Add API Keys to Your Portfolio

You need to add your Contentful API keys to your environment:

```bash
# Add these environment variables to your hosting environment (e.g., GitHub, Netlify, Vercel)
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=your_space_id_here
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
```

For local development, you can create a `.env` file (add it to `.gitignore`) with these values.

## Step 6: Test Your Integration

1. Deploy your site or run it locally
2. Navigate to the blog section
3. Verify that your Contentful articles appear
